<p>Instructions for second round<br>

<p>☑️Qualified participants from first round will proceed to second round.<br>


In second round you will be provided a encrypted URL link. <br>



On clicking the link you have to write a password(we will tell you at time of link sharing)👀👀, on entering the password you have to click on  decrypt link and you will get the link for first clue👀<br>



All the links are encrypted, you have to solve the clue,enter the password and click on decrypt link. Like this on entering password for the clue you will unlock🔓 the link for solving next clue☑️☑️<br>



🖱️You may use various networking sites , but all in a seperate tab.⌨️🖥️</p>


<p>Note:<br>

☑️In the password you should not use 🚫Upper case alphabet,numeric digits,spaces and special symbols🚫<br>




☑️For example if answer for a clue is Naman Gupta then you must enter namangupta ,else it will lead to error❌<br>



☑️While opening the link on a seperate tab, copy it first somewhere and then again look for the link🔙, if there is an exclamation mark(!) at the last of the link it is usually not copied, You must place exclamation mark(!)  yourself at the last of copied link and then search for it. Without exclamation mark(!), error will occur❌ <br>
